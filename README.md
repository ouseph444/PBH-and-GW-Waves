# **Primordial Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes Estimation**  

This repository provides a general framework for estimating **Primordial Gravitational Waves (GW)** and **Primordial Black Holes (PBH)** from the **Inflationary Power Spectrum**.  

## **Overview**  

- **Primordial Gravitational Waves (GW)** arise due to quantum fluctuations during inflation and can be detected through their imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) or future gravitational wave observatories.  
- **Primordial Black Holes (PBH)** may form in the early universe due to enhanced fluctuations in the power spectrum, leading to high-density regions that collapse under their own gravity.  

## **Contents**  

1. **`GW.ipynb`**  
   - Implements an algorithm to estimate the spectrum of **Primordial Gravitational Waves**.  
   - Uses the inflationary power spectrum as input to compute the resulting tensor perturbations.  
   - Analyzes the GW amplitude and spectral shape across different frequency ranges.  

2. **`PBH.ipynb`**  
   - Provides an algorithm to estimate the **Primordial Black Hole (PBH) mass fraction**.  
   - Uses the inflationary power spectrum to determine the abundance of PBHs formed in the early universe.  
   - Computes the mass spectrum and constraints based on observational data.  

## **Usage**  

- Ensure you have **Python 3**, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib` installed.  
- Open the notebooks in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Jupyter Lab**.  
- Modify the input parameters of the power spectrum as needed to explore different inflationary scenarios.  

## **Applications**  

- Understanding the connection between inflationary models and gravitational wave signals.  
- Exploring the formation and abundance of Primordial Black Holes as a potential dark matter candidate.  
- Comparing theoretical predictions with observational constraints from **LIGO/Virgo, CMB, and upcoming GW detectors**.
